// Box Model

Box surrounding all elements on the document used for layout.
From inside to out it consists of the content, padding, border, and margin.

// Margin
A property used to create extra space around an element. The margin CSS property is a shorthand for
margin-top, margin-right, margin-bottom, margin-left in that order.
A value of auto can also be used to allow the bowser to choose margins, which will usually center block
elements horizontally.
With vertical elements, we use whichever margin is bigger, with horizontal margins, they add the values together.

// Padding
Property used to create extra space with an element, between the content and border.
The padding CSS property is a shorthand for padding-top, padding-right, padding-bottom, and padding-left in that order.
Ex: padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px

// Border
Property used to create a border around the content and padding of an element. The border css property is a shorthand for
border-color, border-style, and border-width, which it takes as space separated values in any order.
For example, border: 1px solid black would ccreate a one pixel solid black border.

A border-radius can also be used to create rounded corners on an element, regardless of it having a border.
This defined radius of the corners, and a value of 50%, creating circle elements.
Additionaly border-top, border-right, border-bottom, border-left can be used to set borders on a single side of an element.
